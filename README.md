# dotfiles
My dotfiles. Managed using GNU stow.

Can be installed with `./deploy`, or manually (in that case, look into **deploy** anyway, you migh need to perform some additional actions).

# Tips

## Wine software

### Origin Pro
The ony version that worked for me was 2016 32 bit (might've changed, but I didn't try anything new). To fix plot setup, install `winetricks msxml3` and to make "Open File" dialog work switch profile to Windows XP.
